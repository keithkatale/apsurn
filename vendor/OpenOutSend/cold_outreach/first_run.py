"""What a run has to be given before a message can be written or sent.

Four things, and none of them is a preference. This install has to say what is being
sold and to whom, or the agent has nothing to write from. A model has to be reachable,
or there is nothing to write it with. The mail has to be signed by somebody, and
self-hosted means that somebody is the one operator this install runs as. And it has to
leave a mailbox.

**Everything comes from the environment. Nothing is asked.** This program runs from a
timer as often as from a shell, and it is the right-hand side of a pipe besides — both
are places where nothing can be prompted. So a run that is missing something raises one
error naming every variable that would have satisfied it, rather than blocking on a
question nobody is there to answer. An operator who wants to be asked runs the wizard in
OpenOutreach, which owns the human half and exports these names.

**Two of the four are credentials, and both are checked before anything is stored** —
the mailbox by its SMTP login, the model by one ping. Neither provider has a health API,
and an accepted login is the only gate there is. This is what makes reading config fresh
on every run safe: the failure an operator used to hit halfway through a pass, with a
mailbox open and a lead already chosen, is caught here instead.

**`outsend send` calls this before any mail moves**, so an operator who wired the pipe
into a timer never discovers a setup step they did not know to run.

**What is stored is what was measured**, and only that: the mailbox row holds its own
spacing clock and the capacity it learned from the provider, seeded once from the
environment because a box is connected by an SMTP login rather than by a variable.
