"""Django settings for the sender — this repo's own, and one host of its apps, not the only.

`cold_outreach` used to be an app inside somebody else's project, which is why the
transport arrived here with no way to start. It has its own settings module now, and
everything an install writes hangs off one root: `defaults.state_dir()`, `~/.openoutsend`
by default. The finder made the same choice for the same reason — from a wheel the
package directory is site-packages, and neither a database nor an operator's mail
history belongs there.

**These apps are hosted twice.** OpenOutreach installs them in one registry beside
OpenOutFind's, which is why the labels are namespaced `outsend_*` — OpenOutFind has its
own `core` — and why what the apps require of a host lives in `defaults.py` and is
splatted here rather than spelled out in two settings modules that can drift.

**The operator seam is the environment, and it is the whole of it.** A variable that
only ever configures the process — where the state dir is, which local clock the sending
window is measured in — is read here and lands as a setting. A variable that answers
something a send cannot run without is read by `core/config.py` on every run and checked
by `first_run.check_ready()` before any mail moves. Nothing is stored: what an operator
types is not this program's to remember, and what makes that safe is the check, not a
row. The failure it guards against is real — a setting missing at the point of use is
discovered mid-pass, per lead, with a mailbox already open.
