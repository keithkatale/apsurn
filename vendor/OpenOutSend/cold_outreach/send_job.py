"""A bounded run: open N conversations, however long the clocks take.

`outsend send 5` says *five new conversations*, and this reaches that goal the way
`openoutreach find 5` reaches its own — by working until the number is met or until
nothing can produce another one. The difference is what stands in the way. The finder
is blocked by *work*, so when nothing can advance it stops and there is nothing to wait
for. The sender is blocked by *clocks*: a box that just opened one is three to four
minutes from opening the next, a pool at its ceiling is a day from opening any, and a
Friday evening is Monday morning. Those all resolve by themselves, so this waits.

**The state machine already knows when.** Nothing here re-implements a guard: it asks
the pool the same three questions in clock form (``Mailbox.objects.next_first_email_at``
— spacing, window, daily cap) and sleeps until the answer. That is what makes an
external cycler unnecessary rather than replaced — the thing it was polling for is a
timestamp this side can read directly.

**The wait is spent working.** Every slice ends in a whole pass, so the mail is read and
replies are answered on a five-minute cadence throughout (``conf.WAIT_SLICE_SECONDS``);
only the openers are on hold. Follow-ups and replies do not count toward the goal — the
goal is cold volume, and answering somebody who wrote to you is not that.

**What ends a run that is not finished:**

    drained     nobody left to email — the lead pool is the one thing waiting cannot
                refill, since ingest is a separate invocation. This is the one ending
                `send all` is *asking* for, and it ends that run successfully
    no box      no mailbox connected, which no clock resolves
    refused     two passes in a row that failed a send and opened nothing — a receiver
                saying no, as opposed to the blip a single failure might be
    Ctrl-C      the operator's own deadline; the conversations already opened stand

`outsend send` with no count stays exactly one pass, because a timer wants a pass and
not a resident process.
