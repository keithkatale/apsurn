# cold_outreach/emails/steps/reply.py
"""Answering someone who wrote back.

This step runs on a deal whose newest inbound message is newer than its newest
outgoing one, so there is always something to answer and the agent is never asked to
decide about silence. **Silence is `emails/steps/follow_up.py`'s question, not this
one** — a lead who says nothing gets at most two more cold emails and then the pursuit
ends; a lead who answers is here, and is never chased again.

Sending here is **exempt from the daily cap, the send spacing and the sending
window** — the only outbound mail that is. Answering within minutes of being written
to is more human, not less, and a reply is not cold volume: it is bounded by how many
people write back, so it competes for nothing.

**A follow-up is the opposite on every count**, and the reason is the machinery this
rewrite deleted. The old scheduler had a per-deal countdown (``next_follow_up_at``)
the agent re-armed itself, a claim priority putting follow-ups *above* first emails,
and — because that priority is not ownership — a floor (``OPENER_FLOOR_FRACTION``)
reserving a quarter of the mailbox for first contact. All of it existed because open
threads accumulate faster than they close, so an unbounded follow-up drain eventually
owned every send in the box: measured on a live install, 102 follow-ups and 1 first
email in a week. Chasing came back without any of it — no countdown on a row, no
separate budget, no reserved fraction — because follow-ups now draw from the same
capped and spaced pool as openers, which makes that ratio arithmetically unreachable
rather than something a floor has to defend against.
