"""Writing again to somebody who never answered.

Chasing was deleted once, for a reason that was really about *priority*: follow-ups
outranked openers out of a separate budget, and a live install measured 102 follow-ups
against 1 first email in a week. These tests hold the shape that makes that
unreachable — one budget, a cap on touches, and a gap measured backwards from the mail
log rather than scheduled on a row.
