"""`outsend` — the command on the right of the pipe.

    openoutreach find 50 --json | outsend

**On the pipe it takes no verb and no arguments.** Things on the right of a pipe
conventionally take none: `| less`, `| jq`, `| tee`. The two verbs it does have are the
ones that are not on the pipe at all: `send`, which reads no stdin and mails what is
already stored, and `init`, which asks for what a first run needs — what this install
sells and to whom, the model that writes it, who is signing the mail, and the mailbox
it leaves from.

**Ingesting and sending are separate invocations on purpose.** A pipe's right-hand side
must not block on the network while a producer is still writing, and the cadence the two
want is different — leads arrive when `find` runs, mail moves on the mailbox's clock. So
the cron line is two entries, not one command doing both.

**stdout is reserved and stays clean**, so the stream composes and a receipt can
never corrupt it. Everything narrated — the counts, a skipped line, Django's own
migration chatter — goes to stderr.

**The exit code is the only acknowledgement a pipe can carry**: 0 means the rows are
durably persisted. Non-zero after a skipped line does *not* mean *nothing to
reconcile* — the good rows are stored and a re-run is safe, because ingest is
idempotent; it means a producer emitted something unreadable and somebody has to know.
