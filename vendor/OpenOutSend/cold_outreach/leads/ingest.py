"""Ingest — JSON Lines on stdin become rows, and the door closes behind them.

The receiving end of `openoutreach find --json | outsend`. It reads, upserts, and
exits; it transmits nothing. Every rule here is the boundary contract's, and each one
exists because the pipe is **at-least-once into an idempotent receiver**: recovery is
running it again, so nothing may depend on a line arriving exactly once.

- **Keyed on `lead_id`.** A re-ingest lands on the row it landed on last time, or
  re-running the pipe is a way of mailing people twice.
- **Latest wins, field by field** — a re-ingest is a *correction*: a lead re-qualified
  under a changed ICP has a new `reason`, and an address filled in by a later
  enrichment beats the blank it replaces. An empty value never overwrites a stored
  one, because "we were never told" is not a correction of anything.
- **Suppression is checked at the door and is terminal.** An opted-out address is
  stored — we still know who they are — and its deal is parked `UNSUBSCRIBED`, which
  no later ingest lifts. A blank address has nothing to check, which is why
  `emails/sender.suppressed` asks again at send.
- **An address that *changed* is re-checked**, because ingest is lead-keyed while
  suppression is address-keyed: a corrected address is an unsuppressed one until
  something looks again.
- **A malformed line is skipped and counted**, named on stderr, and makes the exit
  non-zero. `find` spent real money discovering the rows behind it, so aborting the
  batch throws away paid work — and a silent skip would be worse than either, because
  a producer emitting garbage has to be findable.
