"""The schema on the receiving end of the pipe.

Three tables, and each one answers a question the boundary contract asks:

- **Lead** — the person, keyed on the producer's own `lead_id`. Every field on it is
  a field of the record, so nothing here is derived and nothing is inferred.
- **Deal** — that person's conversation, one row per lead, carrying the finder's
  `reason`. This is also the row the send path walks. (What a message is written
  from — `product_docs`, `campaign_target`, `booking_link` — is not stored at all: it
  comes from `OUTSEND_*` on every run (`core/config.py`), and this install has never
  run more than one campaign, so there is nothing per-deal to hold it against.)
- **Suppression** — the addresses that may never be written to again. Address-keyed,
  terminal, and the one thing an erasure must not remove: forgetting that somebody
  opted out is how they get mailed again.

**The states are this side's.** The finder's funnel ends at `RESOLVED` — an address
in hand — and sending starts after that, so nothing here mirrors a finder state.
