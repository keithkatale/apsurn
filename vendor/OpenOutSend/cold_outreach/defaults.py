"""What a host project must put in its settings for `cold_outreach`'s apps to run.

This repo's own `settings.py` is one host; OpenOutreach, which installs these apps in
its registry next to OpenOutFind's, is another. Both splat `app_settings()` rather than
each spelling the names out, so a name the apps start reading arrives in both from one
definition instead of two that can drift.

Only what the *apps* read belongs here. `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASES` and the rest are the
host's own business — as is `AUTH_USER_MODEL`, which `emails/models/maillog.py` reads
but which every Django project already has; the requirement it does carry is that
`django.contrib.auth` be installed.
