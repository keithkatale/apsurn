# cold_outreach/core/prompt_lines.py
"""**prompt lines** — the part of the opener's prompt that varies, as files on disk.

A prompt line is exactly what its name says: a piece of prompt. It drops into the first
email's system prompt and describes the move that email makes. Everything around it —
who the operator is, the product, the Mom Test discipline, and every hard rule in
``agents/outreach.py`` — is identical whichever line is chosen, so what differs between
two sends is the move and nothing else. That is what makes comparing them later
meaningful rather than merely possible.

**Two directories, and the operator's wins.** Shipped lines live beside this package;
an operator's live under ``state_dir()/prompt_lines``. An id defined in both resolves to
theirs, so a shipped line can be overridden without editing an installed package and
without losing the edit on the next upgrade.

**Selection is random, and that is the honest state of it.** There is no scoring here
and none is faked — a uniform draw, recorded on the message that goes out. The recording
is the part worth doing today: choose at random and write down what was chosen, and
comparing them becomes a query over the log rather than an experiment somebody had to
design in advance. Retrofit it later and every send in between is lost.

**Identity is the id *and* the text.** ``digest`` hashes the prompt, so an edited line
does not silently pool with the version before it. Editing a file is free; discovering
afterwards that two different messages share one name is not, because the old rows
cannot be re-attributed.
