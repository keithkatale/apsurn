"""The `outfind` console script — the single entry point for both readers.

The verbs, in the order a reader meets them:

    outfind check [--json]                    # is this install configured? create the database
    outfind find 10 [emails]                  # find that many more, print the campaign, exit
    outfind status [--json]                   # what is configured, blocked and counted

`find` is the only verb that does work, and it is bounded: it returns when the goal is
met, exits 0 only if it was, and prints the campaign as CSV on stdout — so the CSV is not
a verb either, it is what redirecting the command gives you.

There is no daemon and no default verb. A bare `outfind` prints `OVERVIEW` — the
three verbs and nothing else; the first run is `outfind find 10`, which also creates
the database.

**It deliberately does not hand a bare invocation to Django.** `execute_from_command_line`
answers with every management command it can find, which is fifty lines of
`squashmigrations`, `startproject`, `sendtestemail` and `createcachetable` with the three
verbs buried in a `[core]` block halfway down. That is the first thing anyone sees after
`pip install openoutfind`, and it reads as a Django project shipped by accident.

Django's own commands remain available and reachable — `migrate`, `runserver` (the Admin
at http://localhost:8000/admin/), `createsuperuser` — they are just not the answer to
*what does this tool do*. `outfind help <command>` still goes straight to Django.

Any command accepts `--db PATH` (or `--db=PATH`) to work against a SQLite file
other than the default `~/.openoutfind/data/db.sqlite3`; the `OPENOUTFIND_DB`
env var does the same.

`manage.py` is a thin shim over this module, kept for work inside a checkout.
