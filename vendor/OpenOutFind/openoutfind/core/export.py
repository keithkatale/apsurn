# openoutfind/core/export.py
"""The lead export contract — one record shape, printed by the verb that found them.

This is the finder's **public output**: what leaves OpenOutFind and reaches whatever
the operator actually sends with. The boundary card
(``roadmap/p1-e3-leadfinder-sequencer-boundary.md`` in openoutfind-docs) specifies it,
and the rule it exists to serve is that our own sender gets no privileged path — a
sequencer, a CRM and a spreadsheet all read the same rows.

**The columns are the importers', not ours.** Instantly and Smartlead both *require*
``email``, ``first_name`` and ``last_name``, and both recognise ``company``, ``title``,
``website`` and ``linkedin_url`` as standard fields, mapping anything else to a custom
variable. So the record uses those names exactly — ``company``, not ``company_name``;
``title``, not ``job_title`` — and a file exported here imports without column mapping.
Everything we might like to ship but they do not know (state, campaign, country,
discovery provenance) is left out rather than dumped in as noise variables.

**One record, two serialisations.** ``JSON_FIELDS`` is the record; ``RECORD_FIELDS`` is the
importer-shaped projection of it, and the CSV writer projects rather than defining a second
schema, so the two cannot drift. The whole record crosses as JSON Lines (``find --json``,
read by a sender on the other side of a pipe); the CSV drops ``profile_text``, because a
paragraph in a custom variable is useless to an importer and would cost the property that
makes the CSV worth having.

**The compatibility rule is the substitute for the shared package we are not building**: a
receiver ignores keys it does not know, and this side never renames a key or repurposes
one — it only ever adds. Two repos and one record cannot stay in step on good intentions.

**There is no score column, deliberately.** An earlier version exported the GP's
``P(f>0.5)``. That was a category error: ``core/pipeline/ready_pool.py`` defines
``min_gp_confidence`` as "the paid-lookup spend gate **and nothing else**" — the GP
decides whether to spend a credit resolving an address, not whether a lead fits. The fit
verdict is the LLM's and it is already here as ``reason``, in language a person reads.
Exporting the posterior invited thresholding on a number nobody calibrated, and separated
nothing: every lead in this file already has a Deal, so it already passed the qualifier.

It also made the export expensive and unsafe. Scoring meant ``qualifier_for()``,
which warm-starts over every label and fits a GP — O(n³), minutes on a real install
(2,538 deals on the live install; the docstring there assumes "tens to low hundreds") —
and which calls ``ensure_anchors``, so a cold install would have made **LLM calls and
mutated install state from a read-only export**. This module now touches nothing but the
database.

    both have to be excluded, which is the trap this filter exists to close.

    - **`FAILED`** is the LLM's own rejection (`FAILED` + `wrong_fit`). The `reason` on
      those rows reads *"does not align well with the target market"* — exporting them
      hands a sender the people the model explicitly said no to.
