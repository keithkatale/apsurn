"""Who is running this install.

Self-hosted means one operator, so identity is a lookup, not a parameter. This
replaces the ``OperatorSession`` object that used to be threaded through every
call: it was the browser era's session handle, and once the browser went there was
nothing session-like left in it — just the Django ``User``. The operator is looked
up here.

Nothing is cached across calls. Both reads are a single indexed row and happen at
most once per cycle; a cache would only add a way for a renamed operator to keep
signing emails with their old name until the daemon restarts.
