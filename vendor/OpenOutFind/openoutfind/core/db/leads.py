    Keyed on ``profile_url`` (the provider's per-person URL). Stamps the firmographic
    ``profile_text`` (the LLM qualifier's input) and the embedding from the same row,
    so qualification never re-fetches anything. ``country_code`` is the ICP's target
    country (Lead Finder rows carry no ISO code) — blank means unknown, which the
    contacts-store geo-gate treats conservatively.

    ``discovered_by`` is the query node that surfaced this row; it lands only on first
    touch (a profile another query already created keeps its original node). Its
    ``query_terms`` are folded into the **embedding only** — not ``profile_text`` — so
    the GP learns which query keywords surface good leads while the LLM judges the
    person on firmographics alone.

    The row's person fields (``person_for``) land as named columns and its employer as a
    shared ``Company`` row (``company_for``) — apart from both the text and the vector,
    because the export hands them on as fields and a name would only add noise to the
    embedding. Returns True when a new Lead was created, False when one already existed

# ``suppress_email`` lived here — an opt-out from an address suppressed every lead
# holding it and moved their open deals to UNSUBSCRIBED. It is **gone with the
# sending leg**, and that is a legal position, not a cleanup.
#
# Every mechanism that fed it was a *sending* mechanism: the `List-Unsubscribe`
# header, the `+unsub` alias on the operator's own sending address, the mailbox scan
# that read a client-generated unsubscribe, and the agent recognising a worded request
# in a reply. A finder that never contacts anyone is not the sender under CAN-SPAM /
# GDPR / CASL, so the duty is not inherited — it moves to OpenOutSend with the
# code. Instantly and Smartlead both block a suppressed address at import, which is
# where an opt-out now lands.
#
# ``Lead.disqualified`` itself stays: it is the permanent, account-level exclusion,
# the export filters it, and eleven candidate queries already read it. What is gone is
# the *inbound* path that used to set it from mail we received.
#
# The one suppression duty that does not leave is the hub's, and it never involved a
# sequencer: a person objecting to the shared contacts store is removed via the hub's
# own endpoint, store-wide. That obligation runs between the data subject and the hub.
