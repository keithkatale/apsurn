# openoutfind/core/job.py
"""A bounded run: work until the goal is met, or until nothing can advance.

The daemon this replaces never ended, which is the wrong shape for the reader we care
about most. An agent invoking a tool gets stdout, stderr and an exit code; a process that
does not finish gives it none of the three, so everything it wanted to know had to be
polled out of a second verb or watched in a file. A job with a goal returns all three.

**There is no timeout here, deliberately.** Every unit of work already carries its own
bound — ``deal.not_before`` is the architecture's one retry mechanism, the lookup poll
doubles its own backoff, and ``urllib3.Retry`` bounds the 429s. A job-level clock would be
a second timeout answering a question the first one already answers, and answering it
worse: a clock knows nothing about *why* it is waiting. So the terminal condition is
derived from real state instead — **the job ends when nothing can advance right now**,
which is exactly what ``cycle.run_one_action`` returning ``False`` already means.

**Progress is a set, not a subtraction.** A goal counts the leads that *entered* it during
this run, so a lead the qualifier rejects mid-run cannot silently cancel out one that was
found. It also makes ``--new`` exact for both units: for ``emails`` the rows that changed
are usually leads that were already exportable and merely got an address, which no
timestamp on the row would identify.
