# openoutfind/core/cycle.py
"""One action — do the single most valuable thing available, and say so.

**This module no longer owns a loop.** It used to run a daemon: `run_daemon` rotated
forever, sleeping `CYCLE_SECONDS` between actions. That process never ended, so it could
never return a result — which is why `status`, a `next_action` object and a CSV on disk
all had to exist for anyone to find out what it had done. The loop now lives in
`core/job.py`, is bounded by a goal, and ends when `run_one_action` returns `False`. What
is left here is the hierarchy itself, which never depended on the loop's shape.

**A queue is a status, not a table.** Work is found by asking the deals what they
need (``Deal.objects.filter(state=...)``), so a deal is available because of its own
row. Nothing is created in advance, which means nothing can drift, be lost, or need
reconciling — and no row's timestamp can gate anything but itself.

What this replaces was a *token loop*. ``core/scheduler.py`` wrote ``Task`` rows that
were permission tokens stamped with a time — "at 14:32 someone may send one email" —
without saying to whom; the loop took the earliest-due token, and the
handler then went and found its own target. When no token was due it slept **until
the earliest token's timestamp**. On 2026-08-05 that put a live install to sleep for
34 hours: two BetterContact polls had never terminated, their uncapped backoff had
reached 45h30m, they were the only rows in the table, and 55 ready deals with 70
sends of headroom simply had no token and therefore were not work. The shape was
inherited from the Playwright era, when a token queue was how access to one browser
got serialised. The browser went; the queue outlived it.

Here there is no sleep at all: a job asks for one action at a time and stops when there
is none, and every wait that matters is written on the row that is waiting.

## The hierarchy

One ordered list. The cycle walks it top to bottom and stops at the first thing it
can do, so priority is just the order these are written in:

    1  FINDING_EMAIL          check the lookup            (not_before elapsed)
    2  QUALIFIED              score with the install's model
    3  READY_TO_FIND_EMAIL    buy the address             (free sources first)
    4  (the install itself)   top up the pipeline         (always)

A state that is not listed is terminal, and terminal costs nothing: RESOLVED,
NO_EMAIL_FOUND and FAILED. Most deals come to rest at one of those three,
and resting is free because nothing iterates them.

**There is no spend gate on rows 2 and 4, and that is the shape of the finder.**
Both rows used to share one — *never resolve an address, and never spend an LLM call
qualifying, for someone there is no room to email today* — which was right while
every lead ended in a send. Nothing rations discovery or qualification now: they cost
the operator's own LLM key and nothing else, and the work is bounded the only way that
matters — one unit per call, and a goal that says how many calls. Row 3 is the single
paid step, and even there the payment is the last resort: an address in hand and the
hub cache are tried first and cost nothing, so the key and the credit are checked on
the paid leg alone rather than at the row. What caps the spend is the number the
operator typed, since one credit is one verified address.

**Two rows are gone with the sending leg** — answering a reply and sending a first
email — along with the mail pass and the daily warmth re-measure that fed them. They
live in OpenOutSend now. Leads leave this process over a CSV
(``core/export.py``) and nothing comes back up that wire.

**There is no rotation any more.** ``_rotate`` round-robined multiple campaigns because
a daemon had to decide, forever, whose work to do next. There is one install and one
job at a time now, so the fairness question has nobody to be fair between and the
scheduler that answered it is gone.

    """Do the highest-priority thing available. Returns whether it did.

    Each row is a query and a step. The first one that produces work wins and the
    cycle returns — nothing below it runs, which is what makes the order a priority.

    Every row is timed and named, because the hierarchy is also the only account of
    where the daemon's time goes: the steps log what they *did*, but a row that takes
    twenty seconds to decide it has nothing to do says so nowhere else.

    **``buy_addresses`` defaults to False, so spending is opt-in at every layer.** It
    enables the one paid row; without it no caller can spend a credit, however many
    deals have queued up past the confidence gate. The default used to be True, which
    made *not* spending the thing you had to remember to ask for — and a caller who
    forgets a flag should lose a feature, never money.

    **``max_new_lookups`` bounds how many *more* leads may be handed to ``buy_address``
    this call, independent of ``buy_addresses``.** Without it, a goal counted in
    ``emails`` could submit far more paid lookups than asked for: ``core/job.py``'s loop
    keeps calling this function until a lookup *resolves*, but a submission almost never
    resolves synchronously (the provider is async), so every call that doesn't resolve
    one just goes and submits a *different* lead's lookup instead — one credit and one
    profile handed to the resolver per call, with nothing stopping it at the count the
    operator typed. ``0`` (not ``None``) skips row 3 for this call the same way
    ``buy_addresses=False`` does, so a caller can throttle without disabling spending
    outright.

    **It is a cap on addresses *on order*, not on submissions made** —
    ``job._lookup_budget`` owns that arithmetic and its docstring says why. What matters
    here is that the number can go back **up**: a lookup that misses releases its slot,
    so a row skipped for "budget spent" on one call is live again on a later one, and
    ``may_spend`` must therefore be recomputed per call rather than latched.
