    until the next restart.

    **The cache answers that objection instead of reopening it**, because its key *is*
    the evidence (``_label_fingerprint``). A model can only be handed back when a refit
    would have reproduced it exactly, and the one thing that can change what the GP would
    say — an LLM verdict — always changes the key.

    Which matters because the fit is O(n³) and the loop above is per *action*: 15s at 310
    labels, minutes at 600, and a run pays it on every action forever. Almost none of
    those actions touch a label. Discovery writes unlabelled leads and moves a node's
    offset; buying an address and checking a lookup move a deal's state. Each one used to
    be followed by a full refit to the same posterior — which was most of a run's wall
    clock, all of it spent recomputing an answer we already had.

    It used to be able to return ``None``, for the one case where the freemium
    campaign's downloaded kit was unavailable. With that campaign gone there is no
    such case: the install fits on its own labels, or on its anchors when it has none.
