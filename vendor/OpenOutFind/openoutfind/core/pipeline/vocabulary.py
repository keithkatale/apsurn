# openoutfind/core/pipeline/vocabulary.py
"""The keyword vocabulary — the tokens a discovery query can be built from.

Growth is **counting, not generation**. The old engine asked an LLM to invent clause
values ("propose new job titles adjacent to these leads"), and the LLM wrote prose:
``Head of Content Strategy``, ``Chief Science Officer``, ``Director of Education``.
Every word in a Lead Finder value is another AND, so a four-token title is near-empty
before it is conjoined with anything — a large, independent cause of the 60-consecutive-
empty-query run that started this rewrite. Here the vocabulary is simply *the words that
appear in profiles the LLM already accepted*, one word per keyword, and narrowing happens
by conjoining tokens at query time against measured feedback.

**Admission is document frequency, and it is nearly free.** Over the label store, a df≥2
floor drops 65% of the vocabulary (3,485 → 1,208 tokens) and loses **zero** good tokens —
none with support ≥ 8 and true precision > 0.8 disappears until df≥10. What it removes is
the singleton tail, which is mostly company names and typos (``cloneable.ai``,
``buildteam.ai.``, ``vendbot``) — and that tail is not harmless: it is 56% of the *top* of
any embedding-based ranking, so it would be fired first. See §13a/§13b of the roadmap card
``p1-e3-leadfinder-index-semantics-and-query-model-rethink``.

**A token's field is measured, not chosen.** ``cto`` is alive in ``lead_job_title`` and
dead everywhere else; ``belgium`` is the reverse. Reading each axis from the lead-row
fields that *are* that axis (``discovery.KEYWORD_SOURCE_FIELDS``) keeps the per-field
vocabularies nearly disjoint at no cost. ``lead_seniority`` is the exception and the
easy case: the provider publishes a closed 12-value list, so it is seeded whole and
never grown.

The upgrade path, if the singleton tail ever needs a sharper cut than df≥2, is Dunning's
log-likelihood ratio — it kills df=1 junk *and* the high-frequency-uninformative tokens a
df floor waves through (``services`` reads 25/34 in the store and would score negative).

    contributes *words* and the walk conjoins them. A location is matched as one whole
    place, so it contributes exactly one value.

    Splitting a location on spaces is what this replaces, and it was silently fatal:
    ``United states`` became ``united`` and ``states``, ``New york`` became ``new`` and

    matches this* — pruning its whole subtree over what was really a fact about our
    syntax. A live campaign put 19 such fragments in its vocabulary and killed Israel and
    Spain outright.

    Stopwords are stripped for the same reason they are stripped from profiles, and by
    the same tokenizer, so ``District of Columbia, United States`` still matches a profile
    whose ``of`` was dropped. A keyword that is *nothing but* stopwords keeps its raw
