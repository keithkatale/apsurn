# openoutfind/core/pipeline/top_up.py
"""Filling the pipeline — the one step whose queue is a campaign, not a deal.

Everything else the cycle does is found by querying deals. This cannot be: a lead
nobody has discovered yet has no row to be found. So the bottom of the hierarchy
asks a campaign instead — *do you have enough people waiting?* — and if not, spends
**one** unit of work: label a lead, discover a page, or (in the cold phase) both.

This was the `find_email` handler's hidden second job. Given one queue token it ran
``pools.find_candidate``, a ``while True`` that discovered, LLM-qualified and
promoted until it produced a candidate — anywhere between zero and dozens of LLM
calls behind a single row. Here the loop *is* the cycle: one move per call, and the
caller decides whether to come back.

**The move is the qualifier's own acquisition strategy, unchanged.** This is the
crown jewel and it is ported verbatim:

- **cold phase** (``is_cold`` — invented anchor positives still padding the positive
  class) — do **both** moves every pass: one query in, one label out. Ranking still
  leans on the anchors' *guess* at the ICP, so no observed signal says a label is
  worth more than a page, and a rule that picked one would be a preference dressed
  as a policy. Discovery's return is ignored, so a saturated pool or a provider
  outage still leaves a lead to label; only an empty pool stalls.
- **explore** (``neg ≤ pos``) — label the most *informative* lead (max BALD), with no
  confidence gate: a low-confidence lead is exactly the label that teaches the GP
  most, so filtering by confidence would throw away the point of exploring.
- **exploit** (``neg > pos``) — qualify the strongest lead clearing
  ``min_gp_confidence``, the one whose qualification will buy an email rather than
  park at QUALIFIED. When none clears the gate there is nothing here worth an LLM
  call, so **discover instead**: the same constant gates both the LLM call and the
  paid lookup, so a lead the model would not pay for is not a lead it pays to judge.
  The pool is what widens, never the bar — a pass that discovers leaves the class
  balance untouched and the frontier one node further on, and when the frontier is
  drained too the campaign has honestly run out and ``top_up`` says so.

There used to be a second path here: the freemium promo campaign ran none of the
above, because its leads were already in the account and a downloaded kit model
ranked them. That campaign is gone, so every campaign now takes the one path.
