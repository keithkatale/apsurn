# openoutfind/core/pipeline/discover.py
"""Discovery leg — fire the frontier's best node into first-touch Leads.

The top of the funnel: a page of ICP-matched rows becomes ``Lead`` rows awaiting
qualification. Free (Lead Finder bills nothing, for counting calls *and* paged ones) and
browserless, so wall-clock is the only budget — roughly 45s per page.

One pass is: make sure there is a vocabulary and a frontier, draw a node
(``select.next_node``), page it, and act on what came back. A page with rows is harvested,
the node's offset advances and its children join the frontier. An empty page retires the
node and the loop tries the next one, so a run of dead queries never yields an
empty-handed pass while any live candidate remains.

**Empty is three different facts and they are not interchangeable** — the provider reports
``0`` for all of them (§7 of the roadmap card). ``search`` now also returns
``summary.leads_found``, which separates the fourth case: rows empty while the count is
positive is a *transport artifact*, not an answer. A burst of calls can hand back an empty
page for a 71-million-lead query in 0.0s (§4), and the old walk wrote that down as
"matches nobody" — permanently, and for every campaign. That case is caught by the count,
not by asking twice: an empty page carrying a positive ``leads_found`` never retires
anything, and an empty page with a zero count is believed on the spot.

There is no pre-screen, no clause minting, no LLM in the loop at all past the cold-start
seed: the vocabulary is counted from qualified profiles (``vocabulary.refresh``) and the
frontier is ranked by counting (``select``).
