**This phase already happened; it just never had a name.** `find` migrates the database
and checks its configuration before doing any of the work it is named after — and
announces the config with a single INFO line between the migration narration and the
discovery walk. Getting ready and finding leads are different jobs with different failure
modes, so they are different verbs.

`find` still does all of it, because a fully configured environment must keep running end
to end in one command. What changes is that there is a way to see what you actually
configured, and only then spend anything.

**Nothing is asked and nothing is written down.** Configuration is read from
`OPENOUTFIND_*` on every run (`core/config.py`); this verb reports what that environment
says, checks the model answers to it, and creates the operator row on a first run. An
install that would rather be asked runs the wizard in OpenOutreach.

**The two long fields come from files, not from flags.** A product description is a page
of markdown with newlines and apostrophes in it; shell-quoting that on a command line is a
way to corrupt it quietly.
