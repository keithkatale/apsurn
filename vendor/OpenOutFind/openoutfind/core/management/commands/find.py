"""Find leads, printing the campaign as it goes, until a goal is met or nothing is left
to try.

    outfind find 1                   # one qualified lead, with its reason — free
    outfind find 10                  # ten more leads, guaranteed to spend nothing
    outfind find 10 --emails         # ...and buy addresses for what is ready
    outfind find 10 emails           # ten more *carrying* an address (≤10 credits)
    outfind find 0                   # no work; print what the campaign already has
    outfind find 10 --open           # ...and open each new profile in the browser
    outfind find 10 --debug          # ...and show the walk's reasoning as it goes

**Finding is free; buying an address is not, and the free thing is the default.**
Discovery and qualification cost only the operator's own LLM key, so a bare ``find 10``
cannot spend a credit however many deals have queued up past the confidence gate. The
address lookup is opt-in — ``--emails`` permits it, and the ``emails`` unit implies it.

This was the other way round until 2026-08-21: buying was on unless ``--no-emails``
turned it off, so ``find 10 leads`` quietly bought an address for whatever an earlier run
had left ready. The docstring even called it free. **A flag you forget should cost you a
feature, never money**, which is the whole argument for the inversion.

**The unit is a noun, not a flag**, and that is a budget decision rather than a style one:
the provider bills one credit per verified hit, so ``find 10 emails`` is capped at ten
credits by construction. The number typed is the budget, in the same unit as the invoice.
The noun says what to *count*; the flag says what may be *paid for*. They are independent
in the one direction that matters — counting leads never authorises a purchase.

**Output is progressive by default.** `find` writes what the campaign already has the
moment it starts — before any work — and then writes each new lead's record the instant
its deal settles, rather than collecting everything and printing it once at the end:

    outfind find 20 emails | outsend   # the sender sees the first resolved address
                                              # within seconds, not after the whole run

Cumulatively this is still the whole campaign, which is what makes ``> leads.csv`` correct
by construction: the newest file supersedes every earlier one, and a lead whose address
resolved since last time comes back with it filled in. Nothing about that promise changed
— only *when* each row leaves, never *whether* it does. ``--new`` skips the opening bulk
and only ever streams what this run itself produces, for a caller reading stdout into a
context window rather than into a file.

This is safe in a way a live-updated *file* was not — the daemon this project deleted once
kept a CSV current across a process that ran for days while rows kept changing state under
it, which is exactly the class of bug (naming, collisions, atomic rewrite) that got the
file deleted rather than fixed. A single ``find`` run's deals settle once and stay settled
for the rest of that run, so writing a record the moment it terminates has nothing left to
contradict.

``--batch`` is the escape hatch back to the old shape: nothing is written until the job
ends, then the whole campaign (or just this run's rows, with ``--new``) prints once, in
one call. Reach for it only when a consumer genuinely cannot take a stream — a strict
single-document JSON parser, say.

Exit 0 means the goal was met, and nothing else. Anything short prints its rows anyway and
exits non-zero with one ``error: <type>: <message>`` line — the code says how much you
got, the type says why it stopped.

**The run ends with the one thing to do next**, from `status` and rendered as-is: on
stderr beside the counts, or as the ``next_action`` key of the run object under ``--json``.
A run that stops with ranked leads and an empty wallet has to say so, and this is the only
moment it can.

**One rule serves both formats: stdout is records, stderr is narration.** ``--json`` emits
**JSON Lines** — one record per line, the full record including ``profile_text`` — and the
run's own metadata goes to stderr as one JSON object. Line-delimited rather than one
document because **a truncated stream stays usable**: an object that stops halfway is a
parse error and the whole batch is lost, where a line-delimited one has already delivered
every complete record before the break. ``--json`` and streaming compose freely — the flag
picks the format, streaming (or ``--batch``) picks the timing, and the two questions do
not interact.

**Under ``--json``, stderr is JSON and nothing else** — no banner, no log lines: the run
object, and the ``{"error": …}`` object after it if the run fell short. Otherwise a ``2>``
capture is prose with an object somewhere in it and every caller writes the same fragile
``tail -1``. The cost is the narration an interactive ``--json`` run used to print, and
that is the right trade: ``--json`` is the machine's mode, and a person watching a run is
not using it.
