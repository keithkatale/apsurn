# openoutfind/core/management/base.py
"""The base command that implements the CLI's output contract.

Three rules, and they exist because the reader is as often a program as a person:

  * **stdout is result-only** — the thing you would pipe into ``jq`` or a file. Logs
    and progress go to stderr (``core/logging.py``), so redirecting stdout yields
    data and nothing else.
  * **errors are one line with a stable type** — ``error: <type>: <message>`` on
    stderr, from the vocabulary in ``core/errors.py``, and a non-zero exit. Under
    ``--json`` that line becomes ``{"error": {"type", "message"}}``, still on stderr:
    a caller that asked for JSON is parsing rather than reading, and the same
    vocabulary answers both.
  * **no traceback for an expected failure.** A rejected API key is not a bug; it is
    an answer, and it should read like one.

A freshly installed tool is the fourth case, and it used to be a raw Django traceback:
the database file exists (``settings.py`` creates its directory) but has no schema until
a migrating verb runs, so asking anything else first hit ``no such table``.
