"""What a run has to be given before it can find anybody.

Four things, and none of them is a preference. This install has to say what it sells and
to whom, or there is no ICP to search or judge against. A model has to be reachable, or
there is nothing to judge with. Discovery has to have a key, because the search itself
runs on one. And somebody has to be running it, under a jurisdiction, having accepted
what the tool does.

**Everything comes from the environment. Nothing is asked.** This program is a library,
a pipe stage and a scripted command as often as it is something a person types at, and
none of those can answer a prompt. So a run that is missing something raises one error
naming every variable that would have satisfied it, rather than blocking on a question
nobody is there to answer. An operator who wants to be asked runs the wizard in
OpenOutreach, which owns the human half and exports these names.

**The model is checked, not stored.** One ping before any work starts is what makes
reading configuration fresh on every run safe: a key rotated out from under a timer fails
here, before a lead is chosen, instead of halfway through a pass with a lead already in
hand. That was the whole objection to reading config from the environment, and it is
answered by checking rather than by remembering.

**Two things are records, not answers.** The operator is a ``User`` row, written once
from the environment and never re-read — a renamed variable must not rename the person a
campaign belongs to. The newsletter subscription is an act, performed once when that row
is created, and only on an explicit yes.
