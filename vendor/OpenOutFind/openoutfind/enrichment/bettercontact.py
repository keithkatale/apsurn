# openoutfind/enrichment/bettercontact.py
"""BetterContact email lookup — resolve a work email for a qualified lead.

The paid finder is a **two-leg async handshake**, so the daemon never blocks on
a poll: ``submit(query)`` fires one job and returns its ``request_id``, and
``poll_once(request_id)`` checks that job exactly once (no wait), reporting
``running`` / ``hit`` / ``miss``. The collect task owns the retry backoff between
polls (its payload carries the ``request_id`` + deadline). ``is_configured()``
reports whether an API key is set. A missing key or an unreachable service
raises ``BetterContactUnavailable`` (never a bare error), so enrichment can't
take down the daemon. This is the *paid* finder — distinct from the free hub
lookup (``contacts.resolve``), tried first.

The blocking ``submit_and_poll`` transport remains for Lead Finder *discovery*
(``discovery.py``), which legitimately waits inside its own handler.

Attribution is won at **signup**, not at payment: an operator who creates the account
unattributed and later spends thousands earns the project nothing, and there is no way to
