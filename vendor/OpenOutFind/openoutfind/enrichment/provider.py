# openoutfind/enrichment/provider.py
"""The email-finder seam: one interface, one configured provider, two transports.

``lookup.py`` drives *a* provider, never a named one. Which module answers is decided
here by ``active()``, from whichever key the operator configured — so an install with an
Apollo key and an install with a BetterContact key run the same pipeline, the same
states and the same hub give-back, and neither knows about the other's vendor.

**The interface spans sync and async, because the two real providers differ.**
BetterContact is a waterfall that takes seconds to minutes: ``start`` fires a job and
returns a handle, the deal parks at FINDING_EMAIL, and ``poll_once`` checks it later.
Apollo's ``people/match`` answers in the same HTTP call. Forcing either into the other's
shape would cost something real — a fake handle for Apollo would invent a poll that
resolves instantly and a state the deal passes through in microseconds, while blocking
on BetterContact would hold a run open for minutes per lead. So ``start`` returns a
``Lookup`` that is *either* a finished ``PollOutcome`` or a handle to poll, and the
caller branches once on which it got.

A provider module is a plain module — no classes to register, no plugin table. It
implements:

    NAME            str, the wire value for the hub's contribution origin
    SIGNUP_URL      str, the one attributed path to an account
    is_configured() bool — is there a key
    credit_balance() int — raises ProviderUnavailable if it cannot be read
    start(url)      Lookup — resolved outright, or a handle
    poll_once(id)   PollOutcome — async providers only; sync ones never see a call

**Adding a provider (including in a fork).** Write the module against the six names
above, then add it to the three registries below (``active``, ``by_name``,
``configured``) — that is the whole integration; nothing else in the codebase names
a vendor.

``NAME`` is the part that leaves the machine. ``lookup`` passes it straight to
``contacts.contribute`` as the give-back's ``origin``, and it travels to the hub as
that **string**, never as a number — so pick a short lowercase slug for your vendor
(``"hunter"``, ``"dropcontact"``) and keep it stable, because it is what your
contributions are grouped by forever after. The hub stores it verbatim whether or not
it has ever heard of you, so a fork's own finder stays legible on the analytics side
with no change needed there; only the small-int fast path in the hub's
``Contribution.Origin`` is limited to the vendors upstream ships. Do not reuse another
vendor's ``NAME`` to "fit in" — that silently merges your spend into theirs.
