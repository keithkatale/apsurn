# openoutfind/enrichment/lookup.py
"""The paid email lookup, in two steps: buy the address, then check on it.

``buy_address`` resolves free sources first — an address already on the lead, then
the hub's cross-operator cache — and only pays the configured finder when both miss.
**Which finder that is, this module does not know**: ``provider.active()`` answers with
whichever vendor the operator holds a key for, and the two differ only in whether they
answer in the same call. An async finder returns a ``request_id`` and nothing waits on
it — the deal parks at FINDING_EMAIL carrying the handle and ``check_lookup`` polls it
later; a sync one is already terminal when ``start`` returns and lands on RESOLVED
without touching FINDING_EMAIL at all.

    already has email  → RESOLVED                (no lookup, no credit)
    free hub-cache hit → RESOLVED                (no provider job, no credit)
    sync finder hit    → RESOLVED                (one call, no handle, no poll)
    async submit       → FINDING_EMAIL           (job submitted, poll from the deal)
    couldn't run       → stays READY_TO_FIND_EMAIL (no key / no credits / API down)

**The free sources are not gated on the paid one.** The key check sits in ``_submit``,
on the paid leg alone, and an empty wallet is a 402 raised from the same place — so an
address already in hand and the hub cache still resolve when there is neither key nor
credit, which is precisely when a free hit is worth the most. The gate used to stand one
level up, in ``cycle._buy_addresses``, where a missing key turned off the free reads too.

**The handle lives on the deal**, not in an external row: ``lookup_request_id`` and
``lookup_attempt`` are columns, so an in-flight job survives a restart and its
backoff (``not_before``) gates that one lead and nothing else. The retired task
queue held both in a queue row whose due-date doubled as the daemon's sleep horizon
— two stalled polls once put a whole install to sleep for 34 hours with 55 deals
ready to send.

**A running job is never abandoned.** There is no deadline and no attempt limit:
the poll interval doubles on the same ``request_id`` and the deal waits. Abandoning
was tried and is worse — it reverted the deal to READY_TO_FIND_EMAIL, where the buy
step bought a *second* job for the same lead, turning a provider outage into 418
submits and 4,512 polls in a week for ~40 leads, none terminating. Doubling makes
waiting nearly free (a week costs 17 polls), and it refuses to mislabel: a timeout
is evidence about the provider, never about whether this person has a findable
address.
