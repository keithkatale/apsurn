# openoutfind/enrichment/apollo.py
"""Apollo email lookup — resolve a work email for a qualified lead, synchronously.

**Wired but not exposed, and never run against a live key.** Nothing documents
``apollo_api_key`` and no wizard step offers it, so this module only runs for someone who
sets the key deliberately. Two facts are still unverified because they need an account:
which plan tier unlocks ``people/match``, and whether ``credit_balance`` works at all —
it needs a master key, which may be Organization-tier only. Everything below is written
from the published API docs and tested against mocks. Before exposing it: verify both on
a real key, add the ``/go/apollo`` redirect (see ``SIGNUP_URL``), teach the hub an
``apollo`` contribution origin, and validate ``SiteConfig.email_finder`` so a typo raises
instead of silently disabling enrichment.

Apollo's ``people/match`` answers in one HTTP call, so ``start`` returns a finished
``PollOutcome`` and ``poll_once`` is never reached: there is no job, no handle, and the
deal goes READY_TO_FIND_EMAIL → RESOLVED without passing through FINDING_EMAIL. That is
the whole difference from BetterContact; everything above this module is shared.

**Only the work email is asked for.** ``reveal_personal_emails`` and
``reveal_phone_number`` stay off: the personal address is a separate credit and a
GDPR-gated field this product has no use for, the mobile is eight credits, and either
flag switches the endpoint to asynchronous webhook delivery — which would drag the whole
async handshake back in for data we do not want. ``run_waterfall_email`` is off for the
same reason plus a worse one: it can bill per vendor lookup *regardless of result*,
turning a miss from free into expensive.

**A miss costs nothing.** Apollo charges 1 credit for an address and 0 when it finds
none, so an unresolvable lead is free — unlike a submit-and-poll vendor, where the
credit goes the moment the job is accepted.
