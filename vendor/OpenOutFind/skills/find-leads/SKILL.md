description: Find qualified B2B leads with OpenOutFind — run `outfind find N [emails]`, read the CSV it prints on stdout, and hand the rows to whatever sends. Use when the user wants leads, prospects, an ICP-matched contact list, or asks what a campaign already has. Also covers first-run setup (`outfind check`), `outfind status`, and when a lookup costs money.

# Finding leads with OpenOutFind

OpenOutFind is a self-hosted CLI lead finder. You describe a product and a target market once;
each run discovers candidates from a licensed data source, has an LLM judge each one against that
ICP, **writes down why**, and prints every lead it has as CSV on stdout.

It is one bounded command: ask for an amount, get rows, exit. **There is no daemon, no background
job, no file the tool writes for the operator, and nothing to poll.** If you find yourself wanting
to tail a log or wait for something, you have the wrong model of this tool.

It does **not** send email. The deliverable is a CSV for whatever the user already sends with.

## Is it installed?

```bash
outfind status          # human summary
outfind status --json   # the same document, for you to parse
```

If the command is missing, run it through `uvx` instead — `uvx openoutfind ...` — or install it
with `pip install openoutfind`. Inside a checkout of the repo, `python manage.py <verb>` is the
same entry point.

`status` never blocks and never spends. It answers `config` (complete, or which `OPENOUTFIND_*`
variables are missing), lead and deal counts, the credit balance, anything `blocked`, and a
`next_action` — start there whenever you are unsure what state the user is in.

## Setup, if `status` says the configuration is incomplete

**Configuration is the environment, and nothing is stored.** There is no wizard here and no config
row: every value is read from `OPENOUTFIND_*` on every run, so setting up an install means exporting
these — which is also why nothing ever has to be re-entered in a container or a CI job.

| Group | Environment variables |
|------|----------------------|
| campaign | `OPENOUTFIND_PRODUCT_DOCS`, `OPENOUTFIND_CAMPAIGN_TARGET` |
| llm | `OPENOUTFIND_AI_MODEL`, `OPENOUTFIND_LLM_API_KEY` |
| bettercontact | `OPENOUTFIND_BETTERCONTACT_API_KEY` |
| account | `OPENOUTFIND_OPERATOR_EMAIL`, `OPENOUTFIND_OPERATOR_COUNTRY`, `OPENOUTFIND_ACCEPT_LEGAL_NOTICE` |

```bash
outfind check           # is this install configured? creates the database, spends nothing
```

`check` creates the database, verifies the model answers to the key it was given, prints what this
run was told, and stops **before spending anything**.

The product description and target market are pages of prose, so pass them as files rather than
shell-quoted strings — quoting a markdown paragraph on a command line corrupts it quietly:

```bash
outfind check --product-docs product.md --target target.md
```

**Never accept the legal notice on the user's behalf.** If `OPENOUTFIND_ACCEPT_LEGAL_NOTICE` is
unset, say so and let them set it; do not export it yourself. It is read on **every** run, not
recorded once.

You never need to run `check` first — `find` checks the same things — but do run it when the user
has not configured anything, because it fails cheaply and prints the configuration it read, so a
misread product description is caught before any work.

## The one work verb

```bash
outfind find 10                 # ten more qualified leads — free, and cannot spend
outfind find 10 --emails        # ...and buy an address for whatever cleared the gate
outfind find 10 emails          # ten more *carrying* a verified email (≤10 credits)
outfind find 0                  # no work at all — just print what is already there
```

Three things about `N` that are easy to get wrong:

- **`N` is how many *more*, not a total.** A store with 30 leads answers `find 10` by working
  until it has 40. Runs are fully resumable; re-running continues rather than restarting.
- **`find 0` does no work and spends nothing.** It is how you re-export, or answer "what do we
  have?" without running a job.
- **`N` is a budget when the unit is `emails`.** The provider bills one credit per verified hit, so
  `find 10 emails` is capped at ten credits by construction — the number typed is in the same unit
  as the invoice.

### What costs money

Discovery and qualification are free (they cost only the user's own LLM key). **The address lookup
is the only paid step**, and it is opt-in:

- a bare `find N` **cannot** spend a credit, however many leads are queued past the confidence gate;
- `--emails` permits buying for whatever is ready;
- the `emails` unit implies `--emails`, because a goal counted in addresses cannot be met without
  buying them.

**Do not add `emails` or `--emails` unless the user asked for email addresses.** If they said
"find me leads", run the free form and tell them the paid form exists. A lead with no address still
exports — the row carries the person, the company and the reason with a blank `email`.

### Other flags

| Flag | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `--new` | Print only the rows *this run* produced, instead of every lead in the store. Use this when you are reading stdout into your own context rather than into a file. |
| `--json` | The rows as JSON Lines on stdout (the full record, `profile_text` included); the run's metadata — goal, outcome, `next_action` — as one JSON object on stderr, and nothing else there. Prefer it when you are going to parse. |
| `--batch` | Hold everything until the job ends, then print every lead once — the old, pre-streaming shape. Output is progressive *by default* now (see below); reach for `--batch` only if whatever you are piping into cannot handle a stream — a strict single-document JSON parser, for instance. Not something you need for reading into your own context — that is what `--new` is for. |
| `--debug` | Show the discovery walk's reasoning on stderr. For diagnosing a run that finds nothing. |
| `--open` | Opens each new lead's profile in a browser. **Never pass this** — it is for a human at a terminal, and it errors out headless. |
| `--db PATH` | Work against a SQLite file other than `~/.openoutfind/data/db.sqlite3` (same as `OPENOUTFIND_DB`). Accepted by every verb. |
| `--agent-qualify` | Opt out of `AI_MODEL` for the qualify step — see *Answering qualify yourself* below. |

A run can take a while: each lead is an LLM call, and paid lookups are polled. Give it a generous
timeout rather than a short one plus a retry — a killed run wastes the work, though nothing already
qualified is lost.

## Answering qualify yourself, with no second LLM key

If you (the calling agent) are already reasoning about these leads in this conversation,
`OPENOUTFIND_LLM_API_KEY` is a second, redundant LLM bill for a verdict you can write yourself. Add
`--agent-qualify` and the run stops at the first candidate needing one instead of calling
`AI_MODEL`:

```bash
outfind find 10 --agent-qualify --json
```

It runs discovery exactly as normal — free either way — and exits non-zero with `qualify_pending`,
which carries the candidate's own fields right on the error object under `--json`
(`{"error": {"type": "qualify_pending", "profile_text", "company", "job_title", "full_name",
"profile_url", "lead_id", ...}}`, or on the plain-text line without `--json`). Judge the fit the
same way you would judge anything else in this conversation, then re-run the **same command** with
your verdict attached:

```bash
outfind find 10 --agent-qualify --verdict fit --reason "Series B security infra buyer, matches the ICP on team size and stack."
outfind find 10 --agent-qualify --verdict no-fit --reason "Consumer app, not B2B — outside the target market."
```

This resumes from exactly that candidate — no lead id to track, since at most one is ever pending —
records the verdict, and keeps going: either the goal is met, the search runs dry, or it stops
again at the next `qualify_pending`. A rejected verdict disqualifies the lead the same way an
LLM's "wrong fit" would; nothing already found is lost either way, same as `goal_unreached`.

**`--verdict` needs both `--agent-qualify` and `--reason`** — passing one without the other is
`bad_config`. **Don't pass `--agent-qualify` unless you intend to answer every `qualify_pending` it
raises** — a bare `find` without the flag uses `AI_MODEL` and never stops for a verdict at all,
which is the right default for a run nobody is driving turn-by-turn. **`--agent-qualify` also drops
`OPENOUTFIND_AI_MODEL`/`OPENOUTFIND_LLM_API_KEY` out of what `find` requires** for that run — a run
driven this way never needs a model key at all.

## Reading the output

**stdout is result-only; logs, counts and progress go to stderr.** That is the contract that makes
redirection correct:

```bash
outfind find 10 > leads.csv
```

**stdout carries every lead in the store, not just this run's rows.** The newest file supersedes every
earlier one, and a lead whose address resolved since last time comes back with it filled in. It is
one file to overwrite, never a batch per run — so never append, and never stitch runs together.
Rows arrive progressively by default (what is already stored, immediately, then each new
lead as it resolves) rather than all at once at the end — the total is the same either way, so this
only matters if you are piping into something that cannot take a partial stream, in which case
`--batch` restores the old wait-for-the-end behavior.

Columns, in this order:

```
email, first_name, last_name, company, title, website, linkedin_url, reason, lead_id, qualified_at
```

- The names are **the importers'**, not OpenOutFind's: Instantly and Smartlead read
  `email`/`first_name`/`last_name` and recognise `company`/`title`/`website`/`linkedin_url`, so the
  file imports without column mapping. Everything else, `reason` included, arrives as a custom
  variable. **Do not rename these columns** when handing the file on.
- **`reason` is the point** — the LLM's written rationale for choosing this person. It is prose,
  so it contains commas and quotes: parse with a real CSV reader (Python's `csv`, `pandas`), never
  by splitting on `,`. When summarising leads for the user, quote the reason; that is what
  distinguishes these rows from a list bought anywhere else.
- **There is no score column, on purpose.** The model's confidence is a spend gate for the paid
  lookup, not a quality signal — do not go looking for one, and do not synthesise one.
- `lead_id` is the stable key for dedupe across exports. `qualified_at` is when the verdict landed.
- Rejected leads never export: neither the LLM's "wrong fit" verdict nor a permanent
  account-level opt-out.
- **`reason` is written for the operator, not the prospect.** It justifies a yes/no —
  third-person and evaluative. Never paste it into a message to the lead.

**The CSV *is* the integration.** Instantly, Smartlead, Lemlist, HubSpot, a spreadsheet — the file
imports as-is, and there is no adapter, webhook or plugin to look for. One thing to tell the
operator when you hand a file on: **turn on their tool's import deduplication**. It is opt-in on
Smartlead and undocumented on Instantly, so a re-exported lead can otherwise be contacted twice.

**`find 0` is the re-emit path** — no work, no spend, prints what is already stored. That is
what to run for *give me that file again*; there is no `export` verb and none is coming.

### The JSON record

For anything programmatic, prefer `--json` over parsing the CSV. It is **JSON Lines**: one record
per line on stdout, carrying every CSV column plus `profile_text` — the raw firmographic text the
qualifier judged on, which is what a sender writes a message from. The run's own metadata is one
JSON object on stderr:

```bash
outfind find 10 --json > leads.jsonl 2> run.json
outfind find 10 --json | jq -r '.email'          # the records
```

One record, two serialisations: the JSON is the whole thing, the CSV is the importer-safe
projection of it. A reader **ignores keys it does not know** — the finder never renames a key or
repurposes one, and only ever adds.

## Exit codes and failures

**Exit 0 means the goal was met, and nothing else.** Anything short still prints its rows and exits
non-zero with a single line on stderr:

```
error: <type>: <message>
```

Under `--json` that becomes `{"error": {"type": ..., "message": ...}}`, still on stderr. The `type`
is a stable string worth branching on:

| type | What it means | What to do |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| `goal_unreached` | Ran, produced fewer than asked. The rows are on stdout. | Read the message: a drained index is a dead end, addresses on order are a reason to run again later. |
| `not_initialized` | No pipeline at this database yet. | `outfind check` |
| `onboarding_incomplete` | The run was not given everything it needs. | The message names every missing variable; `outfind status` does too. |
| `no_credential` | No BetterContact key. | Configure one; discovery needs it too, and the free tier has 40 credits. |
| `provider_auth` | The key was rejected. | Do not retry; the key is wrong. |
| `provider_out_of_credits` | Credits exhausted. | Free `find N` still works; addresses do not. |
| `provider_rate_limited` | 429. | Back off. **Never retry at speed** — the provider's docs say that can block the account. |
| `provider_unavailable` | Provider unreachable at all. | Transient; retry later. |
| `bad_config` | A value is set but unusable (e.g. a negative count). | Read the message; it names the field. |
| `qualify_pending` | `--agent-qualify` stopped one candidate short of the `AI_MODEL` call it opted out of. | Judge the candidate carried on the error object, then re-run with `--verdict`/`--reason` — see *Answering qualify yourself*. |

Treat a non-zero exit as *partial success with a stated reason*, not as "nothing happened" — the
rows are already on stdout. And never report a failed run to the user as "no leads matched": a
throttled or unauthorised run that reads as an empty result is the worst possible answer, which is
why every failure carries a type.

## Handing the leads on

The export is a one-way boundary: leads leave, nothing comes back. There is no inbound endpoint and
no callback. Whoever sends owns the conversation, the suppression list and the opt-out duty.

So the natural next step after a run is another tool's importer — Instantly, Smartlead, Lemlist, a
CRM, a spreadsheet, or [OpenOutSend](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutSend) for the
sending half. **Tell the user to switch on their sequencer's import deduplication**: it is opt-in on
Smartlead and undocumented on Instantly, so a lead exported twice can otherwise be contacted twice.

## Things not to do

- Don't invent a daemon, a `run` verb, a scheduler, or a watch loop. `find` is the whole of it.
- Don't go looking for an output file. There isn't one unless the user redirected stdout.
- Don't spend credits the user didn't ask for (see *What costs money*).
- Don't parse stderr for data, or expect data on stdout to be anything but the result.
