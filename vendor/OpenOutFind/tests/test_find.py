"""`find` — the one verb that does work, and the only one that boots the install.

Two things are pinned here. **Boot: environment first, wizard only if a human is there to
answer** — the regression an agent-driven install hits first, where the tool used to die
on a missing TTY with a message that named a mailbox (gone with the sending leg) and never
said which variables to set. And **the command's own contract**: which site_config it acts
on, what it prints, and the fact that exit 0 means the goal was met and nothing else.
