"""The discovery loop end to end, with the provider stubbed.

What ``discover`` has to get right is entirely about *what an empty page means*: the
provider answers ``0`` for a query matching nobody, for one paged past its end, for one
that hit the 10k reach cap, and for a burst artifact that is not an answer at all. The
old walk conflated all four and permanently blacklisted good queries. See §4 and §7 of
``p1-e3-leadfinder-index-semantics-and-query-model-rethink``.
