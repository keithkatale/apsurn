"""The bounded job: a goal, and the honest end of the work.

Three things carry the weight. **The goal is a delta** — "ten more than you had" is the
only reading under which running it twice gets you twenty. **Progress is a set, not a
subtraction**, so a lead the qualifier rejects mid-run cannot silently cancel out one that
was found. And **the job ends when nothing can advance**, which is the whole reason there
is no timeout: every wait that matters is already written on the row that is waiting.
