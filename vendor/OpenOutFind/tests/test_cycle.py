"""The cycle: the hierarchy, the ``not_before`` gate, and running without a mailbox.

The test that matters most is ``test_a_stalled_lookup_gates_only_its_own_row`` — it
is the 2026-08-05 incident written down. A deal's timestamp can gate that deal and
nothing else, which is the whole reason the task queue is gone.

Four rows, down from six. Answering a reply and sending a first email left with the
sending leg, and with them every test that asserted a send outranked something.
