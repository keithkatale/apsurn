# Testing

The suite is pytest, mirroring the package structure under `tests/`. Mock at the **boundaries** — the BetterContact client, the hub API and the LLM — never inside business logic.

## Running

```bash
make test                 # full suite (native — tests do not run in Docker)

.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_qualify.py     # a single file
.venv/bin/pytest -k test_name              # a single test by name
```

## Layout

```

*(The `tests/emails/` and `tests/agents/` trees, `test_sending_window.py` and
`test_mail_log_backfill.py` moved to OpenOutSend with the code they covered.)*

## Conventions

- **Mock at the boundary.** Patch the BetterContact HTTP client, the hub client and the pydantic-ai model — not the pipeline functions that call them.
- **CRM objects** come from `factories.py` (factory-boy) or direct model creation.
- **No browser, no network.** There is nothing to launch and no live API to hit; the tool is browserless and every external call is stubbed.

## What the suite does not cover

**A `find` that actually finds.** Every external call is stubbed, so no test — and no manual
run — has yet taken the happy path end to end with live `OPENOUTFIND_LLM_API_KEY` and
`OPENOUTFIND_BETTERCONTACT_API_KEY`. That includes the Claude Code plugin: the skill is
inventoried and fires correctly on the refusal paths (it runs `status`, reads
`onboarding_incomplete`, names the right variables and declines to accept the legal notice
for the user), but a session that returns leads has never been observed. Exercising it costs
one BetterContact credit per verified hit.
