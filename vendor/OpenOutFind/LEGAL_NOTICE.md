# LEGAL NOTICE – OpenOutFind

**Effective upon use of this software**

OpenOutFind is a self-hosted, open-source **lead finder**. It discovers B2B leads from a **licensed third-party data provider**, qualifies them against your described ICP on your own machine, optionally resolves a work email for the best-fit leads through a **paid third-party email-finder**, and hands the result to you as a file. It is **browserless: it does not use, log into, scrape, or automate any social network or professional-network account, and it stores no such credentials.** By running this software, you acknowledge and accept the following facts, risks, and terms.

> **This package does not send email, and never has a mailbox.** It finds, qualifies and exports; the obligations that come with contacting someone sit with whatever tool you send with — see Sections 4 and 5.

> **If you send with [OpenOutSend](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutSend), or with the [OpenOutreach](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutreach) bundle that carries both halves, that project's own Legal Notice governs the sending** — including the line `Sent with OpenOutreach` appended to every message it sends. Nothing in this notice describes or limits it. What *is* gone everywhere is the promotional campaign of the maintainer's own that once took its turn in an operator's sending rotation: it is deleted, and nothing replaced it.

> This notice describes how the software behaves and is **not legal advice**. You are responsible for your own compliance; where the stakes warrant it, consult a lawyer. Material aspects of the data model below are still pending a formal legal review.

### 1. No Platform Scraping or Automation
OpenOutFind performs **no** automated access to any social or professional network — no login, no browser session, no bot, no scraping, no messaging on such a platform. Lead **discovery** comes from a licensed data provider (currently BetterContact **Lead Finder**), and **enrichment** (resolving a work email) comes from a paid email-finder — both third-party services **you** sign up for and configure with **your own** API key, used under **that provider's** terms.

- **Profile URLs are identifiers, not fetch targets.** A discovered lead may carry a professional-network profile URL as an opaque identifier. OpenOutFind **stores it and never visits it** — it is a lookup/dedup key, nothing more.
- **You accept the third-party terms.** You are responsible for using the data provider and email-finder in line with each provider's terms of service and acceptable-use policy.

### 2. Newsletter Subscription (Asked at Onboarding, Default Set by Jurisdiction)
During onboarding you enter the **country** your operation is based in, and you are then **asked** whether to subscribe the email address you provided to the newsletter. The question is always asked; only its **default answer** depends on your jurisdiction.

- **Protected jurisdictions**: for operators based in the EU/EEA, UK, Switzerland, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, South Korea, or New Zealand, the default is **no**. An explicit yes is lawful consent anywhere.
- **Elsewhere**: the default is **yes** — so accepting the prompt without changing it subscribes you.
- **Unknown location**: if the country cannot be read, the software treats you as protected (default no).
- **Opting out later**: the choice is made once, at onboarding, and is acted on immediately (a single subscription request); **there is no stored setting to change afterwards**. To leave the list later, use the unsubscribe link in any newsletter email.

### 3. No Warranty – Use at Your Own Risk
OpenOutFind is provided **AS IS**, without warranties of any kind (express or implied), including fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or that it will not cause harm to your accounts, mailboxes, domains, or data.

The developer(s):
- Do not guarantee any results from using the tool
- Are not responsible for account/domain/mailbox suspensions, deliverability harm, lost business, legal consequences, or other damages
- Recommend you review the terms of every third-party service you connect (data provider, email-finder) before use

### 4. How the Project Is Funded (Affiliate Links)
OpenOutFind is free and open-source. It sustains itself through **affiliate links**: the unavoidably-paid third-party service the tool relies on — the email-finder, which powers both lead discovery and address resolution — is surfaced during onboarding through an affiliate link. If you sign up through one, the project may earn a commission **at no markup to you**. You are free to sign up any other way.

OpenOutFind never sends a message and never touches your mailbox, so nothing here appends an attribution line to anything and no promotional campaign of the project's own exists in any rotation. **The sender is funded differently**: every message [OpenOutSend](https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutSend) sends ends with the line `Sent with OpenOutreach`, always on, disclosed in that project's notice. Installing this package alone never puts that line anywhere. Any hosted service operated by the maintainer is **not** covered by this notice and states its own terms at sign-up.

### 5. Lead Discovery and Email Enrichment
**OpenOutFind does not send email.** It discovers leads, judges them against your described ICP, and writes the result to a file you export. Whatever you use to contact the people it finds is a separate tool you choose, configure and are responsible for.

Address resolution runs through a **third-party email-finder** (e.g. BetterContact) — a paid service you sign up for and configure yourself. It is optional: leads export with their qualification reason whether or not an address was resolved.

- **Data protection**: resolving and storing a person's work email is processing of personal data. Where data-protection law applies (GDPR, UK GDPR, LGPD, etc.) **you are the data controller** and are responsible for a lawful basis, honouring access/erasure/objection requests, and any required disclosures. OpenOutFind provides the mechanism, not legal cover.
- **Anti-spam law is entirely on the tool you send with.** Unsolicited commercial email is regulated — CAN-SPAM (US), GDPR/ePrivacy (EU/EEA), CASL (Canada), the Spam Act (Australia), and others. Requirements commonly include truthful sender and subject lines, a valid physical postal address, and a working, honoured opt-out. **None of these are provided by this software**, because it emits no message in which to provide them.
- **The opt-out duty belongs to whoever sends.** OpenOutFind has no opt-out mechanism of its own, because it never contacts anyone. Your sequencer is the only thing that can honour an opt-out, because it is the only thing that makes contact. Instantly and Smartlead both block a suppressed address at import; confirm your own tool does the same before your first send.
- **Turn on your sequencer's import deduplication.** Exporting the same lead twice can otherwise contact the same person twice. It is opt-in on Smartlead and undocumented on Instantly. This is the one duty the split hands to you that the software cannot do for you.
- **Accuracy**: finder results may be wrong, stale, or belong to a different person. You are responsible for whom you contact and what you send.

### 6. Central Contacts Store (Contribution and Resolution)
OpenOutFind connects to an optional **central contacts store operated by the project maintainer** (`hub.openoutreach.app`). It pools work email addresses across the OpenOutreach network so a contact one operator has already paid to resolve can be served — for free — to another, lowering everyone's email-finder spend as coverage grows. By running the software with contribution enabled you participate as described here.

- **What is contributed, and when**: at the **one** moment a real contact comes into existence — **after a paid email-finder returns a verified work email** — OpenOutFind sends a minimal record: the person's **profile identifier** (the stored, never-fetched profile URL), their **country code**, and the **work email address(es)** resolved. No name, headline, company, title, phone, or profile text is sent. Where a vector for that person is already cached on your machine, the record also carries a **384-dimension numeric profile vector** computed locally — the raw profile text never leaves your machine. (There is no separate switch for the vector: it is included whenever it is already in hand.)
- **Whether you contribute is derived from your country — it is not a setting.** If your operation is **not** based in the EU/EEA, UK, or Switzerland, contribution is **on**, and **there is no toggle to turn it off**: it can be disabled only by modifying the source, which the licence permits. If your operation **is** based there, the software contributes nothing at all (an unreadable country is treated as protected).
- **The consequence for protected operators.** The store works give-to-get: an operator's access token is minted by their **first contribution**. An EEA/UK/CH-based operator therefore never contributes, never earns a token, and so **never resolves from the store** — every lookup falls through to the paid finder. This is a structural consequence of the jurisdiction rule, not a penalty, and it means the store cannot lower your costs if you are based there.
- **Geo-gate on the people in the store**: independently of where *you* are, a contact located in the **EU/EEA, UK, or Switzerland — or whose location cannot be determined — is never written to the store.** This gate runs authoritatively **server-side**; the client's pre-filter is only a bandwidth optimisation.
- **Resolution is a disclosure to third parties.** OpenOutFind reads the store *first*, before spending a paid finder credit. A hit is served free. So an email you contribute **may be disclosed to other operators** to contact that person, and emails others contributed may be disclosed to you. This is a disclosure of personal data to a third party — in substance the commercial-contact-data model (Apollo, Cognism, Dropcontact). It is **not** a sale of data, but it **is** a separate processing purpose from your own outreach.
- **Your role and responsibilities.** Where data-protection law applies, contributing and resolving personal data is processing for which you may be a controller or joint controller alongside the maintainer. **You remain responsible** for a lawful basis (the project relies on legitimate interest for B2B professional contact data only), for honouring access/erasure/objection requests, and for any required notices.
- **Suppression / opt-out.** Any person whose email is in the store can be removed and blocked from re-entry via the store's suppression mechanism (`POST /api/v2/suppress/`), honoured across the whole store. The store publishes a separate **Privacy Notice** for those people at <https://hub.openoutreach.app/privacy/>.

### 7. Your Responsibility
By downloading, installing, configuring, or running OpenOutFind, you:
- Confirm you are of legal age and have authority to accept these terms
- Agree to use the tool only in compliance with all applicable laws (data-protection/privacy law such as GDPR, anti-spam law such as CAN-SPAM/CASL) and with the terms of every third-party service you connect
- Accept full responsibility for the contacts you process, and for any email you go on to send to them with another tool
- Understand that modifying the code to disable the hub contribution is permitted under the licence, but remains your responsibility

If you do **not** agree with any part of this notice — especially the central contacts store — **do not use this software**. Delete it immediately.
